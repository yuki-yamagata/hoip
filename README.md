# Homeostasis imbalance process ontology (HOIP)

The Homeostasis Imbalance Process Ontology (HOIP) systematically categorizes a broad spectrum of processes initiated by homeostatic imbalance. Primarily, HOIP concentrates on the phenomena of cellular senescence and the infectious processes associated with COVID-19. 

The HOIP framework is structured into a three-tiered is-a hierarchy: the top layer encompasses general terms predominantly sourced from the Basic Formal Ontology. HOIP also defines domain-independent functional processes, which allows specialized definitions of biological functional processes as subclasses acting to maintain homeostasis.

In the intermediate layer, HOIP defines the biological processes essential for maintaining homeostasis. To permit interoperability of the knowledge, terms widely used in a biomedical ontology in the OBO Foundry, such as GO, the phenotype ontologies Phenotype And Trait Ontology  PATO and Human Phenotype Ontology HPO, the Uber-anatomy ontology UBERON, the cell ontology CL, the Symptom Ontology, the disease ontology DOID, the protein ontology PRO, ChEBI, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy, were imported into the intermediate layer of the HOIP.

The bottom layer relates to the homeostatic imbalance. Here, to deal with the mechanism of homeostasis disturbances, HOIP defines a “homeostatic imbalance course,” which is a process sequence consisting of multiple processes as a subclass of the BFO’s “process.”
